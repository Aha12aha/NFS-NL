# Need for Speed No Limits
Graphics settings for NO LIMITS versions


Here I will store the various versions of graphics settings for No Limits




Installation: Download the latest version(= to the version installed on your device) and copy to Android/Data/com.ea.game.nfs14_row/files/var



Pro Tip: Make sure you backup your current graphicsSettings.json file either by renaming it or copying it to some other location


Ultra Pro Max Tip: If you are lazy and don't wanna backup, the game will automatically generate that file for you if it's missing.
